  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>Nepali-style rice, or bhat, is a staple side dish that accompanies almost every Nepali meal. The rice is typically cooked plain and served with dishes like daal (lentil soup), curries, and pickles. The simplicity of bhat allows it to balance the rich flavors of Nepali curries and gravies, providing a mild, fluffy base that soaks up spices and sauces beautifully. While plain white rice is most common, sometimes basmati or long-grain rice is used for a more fragrant result.</p>

    <p>In traditional Nepali cooking, rice is often rinsed thoroughly to remove excess starch, resulting in soft, separate grains. Itâ€™s boiled or steamed with just water and a bit of salt, then fluffed up before serving. Some households may add a splash of ghee for added richness. Simple yet essential, Nepali rice is versatile and comforting, a perfect canvas for the vibrant flavors of a Nepali meal.</p><br>
