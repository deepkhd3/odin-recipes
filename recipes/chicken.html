  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>Nepali chicken curry, or *kukhura ko masu*, is a flavorful and aromatic dish that's central to Nepali cuisine. Unlike Indian curries, 
    which can be creamier or have a heavier use of spices, Nepali chicken curry is known for its lighter, earthy taste, combining fresh ginger, 
    garlic, turmeric, cumin, and coriander, with a modest use of tomatoes and green chilies. The chicken is often marinated in spices before cooking,
     allowing it to absorb a deep flavor, then slow-cooked until tender, resulting in a thick, aromatic sauce that clings beautifully to each piece of chicken.</p>

    <p>The dish is traditionally served with steamed rice (*bhat*), pickles (*achar*), and often lentil soup (*dal*), making it a comforting part of the 
        Nepali meal experience. Nepali chicken curry is both spicy and subtly complex, with the use of *timur* (Sichuan pepper) adding a unique, tingling 
        warmth that sets it apart. Each household might add its own touch, sometimes with a dash of mustard oil or fenugreek seeds, lending a distinctive 
        twist to this cherished, homestyle dish.</p><br>

<ol>
  <li>Heat the mustard oil in a large pot over medium heat. Allow it to get hot until it reaches a smoking point, then reduce the heat slightly.</li>
  <li>Add the chopped onions and sauté until they turn golden brown.</li>
  <li>Add the minced garlic, ginger, and green chilies. Sauté for 1-2 minutes until the raw smell fades.</li>
  <li>Add the chopped tomatoes and cook until they soften and blend into the mixture.</li>
  <li>Stir in the turmeric, cumin, coriander powder, and salt. Cook the spices for a minute to bring out their aroma.</li>
  <li>Add the chicken pieces, stirring well to coat them in the spice mixture. Cook for 5-7 minutes until the chicken starts to brown slightly.</li>
  <li>Pour in about 1 cup of water to create a curry sauce. Cover the pot and let the chicken simmer on low heat for 20-25 minutes, or until the chicken is tender and cooked through.</li>
  <li>Sprinkle garam masala and Sichuan pepper (if using) into the curry and stir well. Let it simmer for an additional 2-3 minutes.</li>
