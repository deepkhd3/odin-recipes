    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Nepali-style daal, or dal bhat, is a staple in Nepalese cuisine, a comforting lentil soup enjoyed daily across the country. This version is a simple yet flavorful dish that combines lentils with aromatic spices like turmeric, cumin, and garlic, simmered until smooth and rich. Often made with split yellow lentils (moong daal) or black lentils (masoor daal), the soup is light but nourishing, with a mildly spiced flavor that complements steamed rice and vegetable sides.</p>
  
      <p>Nepali daal is typically tempered with a fragrant tadka or chhonk, where spices are briefly fried in hot oil and poured over the cooked lentils for added aroma and depth. It is often garnished with cilantro, adding a fresh, herby note to the warm, earthy flavors. This versatile dish is easy to make and can be adjusted for thicker or thinner consistency to suit personal preference, offering a comforting, protein-rich accompaniment to any Nepali meal.
